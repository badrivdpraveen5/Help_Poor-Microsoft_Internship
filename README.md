donate page:

When you give a donation, you will be able to set an example for the people around you. You will work as an inspiration for the people who might not have been donating. It means that charities will receive more donations and so it would be easier for them to work on their cause.

How you can Help


We want to do more and you can help. By committing a small fraction of your income to protect children in need, you can help save a child and contribute to humanity. You can donate as low as INR 500 per month.
While Save the Children appreciates monthly donations more where you choose to donate a small fixed amount monthly for us to be able to plan our programs for longer term, a single donation can also help save a child.
You will get your tax exemption certificate within 15 days of your one time donation (quarterly in case of regular donors, who pledge monthly donations, after their first month’s donation). You will get quarterly updates on how you are making a difference.
